    "There are N caves in a row, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the radiation power in the i-th cave is Ci. Originally, the radiation level in each cave was 0. Then, for each valid i, the radiation power in cave i increased the radiation levels in the caves i−Ci,…,i+Ci inclusive (if they exist) by 1, so all the caves are radioactive now.\n",

    "Radiation is not the only problem, though. There are also N zombies with health levels H1,H2,…,HN. You want to kill all of them by getting them to the caves in such a way that there is exactly one zombie in each cave. A zombie dies in a cave if and only if the radiation level in that cave is equal to the health level of the zombie. Is it possible to kill all the zombies?"
